{"name":"iOS-WebP","tagline":"Google's WebP image format decoder and encoder for iOS","body":"#iOS-WebP\r\n\r\nMost apps nowadays enhance user experience with the use of images, and one of the issues I've noticed with that is the amount of time it takes to load and image. (_Not everyone has the luxury of a fast connection_)\r\n\r\nGoogle's WebP image format offers better compression compared to PNG or JPEG, allowing apps to send/retrieve images with smaller file sizes, reducing request times and hopefully providing a better user experience.\r\n\r\n![alt demo](http://i.imgur.com/V4fBG1h.png \"Demo Screenshot\")\r\n\r\n#Getting Started\r\n\r\n###The CocoaPods Way\r\n```ruby\r\npod 'iOS-WebP', '0.2'\r\n```\r\n\r\n###The Manual Way\r\nInclude the 3 files inside the `iOS-WebP` folder into your project:\r\n* `UIImage+WebP.h`\r\n* `UIImage+WebP.m`\r\n* `WebP.framework`\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\nDon't forget to `#import \"UIImage+WebP.h\"` or `#import <UIImage+WebP.h>` if you're using cocoapods.\r\nThere are 3 methods in `iOS-WebP`, converting images __to__ WebP format, converting images __from__ WebP format, and setting an image's transparency.\r\n```objc\r\n+ (UIImage *)imageFromWebP:(NSString *)filePath;\r\n+ (NSData *)imageToWebP:(UIImage *)image quality:(CGFloat)quality;\r\n- (UIImage *)imageByApplyingAlpha:(CGFloat)alpha;\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the methods are pretty easy:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n//Converting To WebP\r\n// quality value is [0, 100]\r\nNSData *webpData = [UIImage imageToWebP:[UIImage imageNamed:@\"image.jpg\"] quality:75];\r\n\r\n//Converting From WebP\r\nUIImage *webPImage = [UIImage imageFromWebP:@\"/path/to/file\"];\r\n\r\n//Setting image transparency\r\n//alpha value is [0, 1]\r\nUIImage *transparencyImage = [[UIImage imageNamed:image.jpg] imageByApplyingAlpha:0.5];\r\n```\r\n\r\n#To-Do\r\n* Fix gray background on WebP images with transparency values < 1\r\n\r\nCredit\r\n========\r\n* Based off [WebP-iOS-example](https://github.com/carsonmcdonald/WebP-iOS-example \"WebP-iOS-example\") by Carson McDonald\r\n* Image transparency function contributed by [shmidt](https://github.com/shmidt)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
